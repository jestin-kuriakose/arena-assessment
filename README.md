# arena-assessment

This project includes frontend and the api with connection to a mySQL database.

To run the backend from vscode, open the project folder and type it in the terminal-

cd api
npm run dev

To run the frontend, open the project folder and type it in the terminal-

cd frontend
npm run dev

The admin panel can be accessed in the frontend by going to '/admin' link. 

This project is missing the following requirements:
1. No User authenticated has been added to this project yet, especially to access the admin panel.
2. The file upload component is incomplete, so you wouldn't be able to upload pictures from the admin panel to update the frontend.
